# TLDForm
Senior Capstone Project

**Aaron TO DO: Urgent**

* ~~Add Authorize User Button~~
* ~~Add Authorise User Form that saves and submits~~
* ~~Only Admin Authorize User Form~~
* ~~Send email from dummy email with Register email link~~
* Add Generated link to Authorize/Register email
* Hide Register tab
* Export Data from Database as XML to be emailed to company

**Aaron TO DO: Cosmetic**

* Make Code cleaner for authorized buttons (Specifically, not wrapping everything in "if authorized" statement)
* Maybe generate GUID and have dynamic URL for register? Too much?

**Aaron Questions**

* Do we have an Azure account?(Not yet)
* How to view database information (was weird on my end, but didnt try too hard to look)
* Who is going to edit RAD?(Dane already did it)
* Do we **need** to be able to send multiple forms in one submit? (Brainstorm this)(yes)
